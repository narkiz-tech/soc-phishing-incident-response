# Phishing Incident Response & Simulation Case Study

This repository documents a **phishing incident response case study** and **phishing simulation analysis** conducted using **IRONSCALES** during a cybersecurity internship.

The project demonstrates how phishing incidents are detected, analysed, and responded to from a **junior SOC analyst perspective**, using real-world security tooling and anonymised evidence.
